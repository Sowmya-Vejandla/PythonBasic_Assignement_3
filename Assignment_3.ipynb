    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs? \n",
    "\n",
    "   Functions provide an organised and productive approach to handling and organising code, increasing maintainance and reusability. They improve the readability, modularity, and abstraction of the code, which facilitates understanding, debugging, and extension of the programme.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Functions put together a block of code that performs something particular. Once defining it, function can be used again inside one programme or different programmes. This promotes code reuse and helps in writing modular and maintainable code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Code maintenance is made easier by functions. If changes or a bug needs to be fixed, you only need to make one change to the function, and all the places where the function is used will receive the updated version. This reduces the chances of introducing errors and makes it easier to update or enhance your code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Functions help you to break down complicated tasks into smaller, easier to handle components. Because each function may address specific parts of the larger issue, the code is simpler to understand, test, and debug. It improves programme's overall structure and readability by breaking the code up into smaller functions.\n",
